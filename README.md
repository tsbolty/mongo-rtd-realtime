  ## Description
  This is a node application that will gather live data from Denver RTD and post that data to a MongoDB database. It will query information every 30 seconds and replace all collections in the database with the updated version. This can also be used to compile historical data to create your own RTD statistics.

  ## Usage: 
  This is a back-end application. The user may need to configure to be used with their database. This will also continue to run every 30 seconds until the process is manually exited.
  
  ## Contributing: 
  There are several directions this app can take. If you would have an idea to use this live data or the historical data, I would love to hear it.
